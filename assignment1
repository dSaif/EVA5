#1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

Channel is a holder of specific information in a context. The number of channels and information available in the channel would depend on the image. In a grayscale image we have single channel that contains intenstiy of the color at a pixel but in an RGB image we have 3 channels for each color channel. Collection of channel is called a Layer.

Kernels are multidimensional array of weights that are applied to a part of data to compute dot product of weights & data. The kernel extracts an feature and produces a feature map as output.


#2. Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?

Advantages of using 3x3 kernels:
1. Calculations makes easier.
2. We can create a filter of any size my addling mulitple layers using 3x3.
3. Smaller filters need lesser parameter calculation then bigger kernels.
4. instead of using an even number like 2 or 4 we use odd number of 3 because it preserves the symmetry in the information in the receptive field.
5. Architectures are based on 3x3 so 3x3 Kernels are more accelarated then other in most of the hardware available today.

#4. How are kernels initialized? 

Kernwels are initialized via an initialization procedure. There's a variety of methods how, including simple ones like random and Gaussian and there's also more advanced techniques like He initialization, MSRA initialization , Xavier initialization/Glorot initialization.


#5. What happens during the training of a DNN?

1. We create a NN with mulitple convolution layers
2. Each layer will have kernels initialized randomly
3. After each convolution layer we get a larger receptive field
4. The last convolution layer will be big enough receptive field that help us in determining the features on the input.
5. If incorrect features have been identified we update our kernels and repeat the above steps, till we get right set of features.
